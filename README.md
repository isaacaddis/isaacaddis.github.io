## Design Rationale

Ironically, I recieved some design inspiration from minimalism. The main content of the website is left aligned (with a bit of padding of course), but a background of white color. The light grey of the content section presents a bit of attention to the section.

Github hosting does not support any server-side hosting so I simply opted to use a clickable email link, rather than a form (the solution I previously had)

## Future Improvements/To-Do
	
1. Fix Mobile Cover photo sizing problem
2. Create a preloader for the site
3. Add more projects and articles
